Please inquire with the shelter.<p/> Current Location: In RASKC Foster Home <p/>Karl is a big guy with a matching cattitude. He would be best as the only pet in the house unless he could get a proper (and long) introduction, as he thinks he is the alpha male. In foster care he tolerates three other cats that are all submissive. He was traumatized by the death of his owner when he was brought in to RASKC, and after two months in foster care he has settled down quite a bit. Sometimes he will jump up on your lap, headbutt you and purr, and a few minutes later hiss and jump down. At this time he needs a forever home with lots of attention so he can settle into being a happy cat all of the time. Note that it has taken several weeks to get to where he is now and will likely regress some when he moves. It will require some patience but it will be well worth it as he can be a big, loving and cuddly kitty. He'll even sleep under the covers with you.<p/><p/>Karl is not a picky eater and is 100% when it comes to the litter box. He marks his ""territory"" with a headbutt only and does not spray (whew!). He loves his cardboard scratching post and is absolutely crazy about catnip and his catnip banana. A laser pointer is a must as is a feather on a string for play. He is an exclusively inside cat but does like to spend some time in the catio to get away.<p/><p/>You can meet Karl at his foster home and have any of your questions answered.<p/>",REDK19-115007,A578798,Regional Animal Services of King County,ADOPTABLE,https://kingcounty.gov/depts/regional-animal-services/about-us/overview.aspx,In RASKC Foster Home,Mcgonagall,Cat,9 MONTHS,Spayed Female,Domestic Shorthair,Brn Tabby / White,1/22/19 0:00,Received on,21615 64TH AVE S,KENT,WA,98032,KING COUNTY,47.407788,-122.255197,https://petharbor.com/get_image.asp?RES=Detail&LOCATION=KING&ID=A578798,Image Copyright HLP Inc. 2019,"Received on: 2019-01-22<p/> Description: Brn Tabby / White Spayed Female Domestic Shorthair Cat<p/> Age: 9 MONTHS<p/> Adoption Fee: An Adoption Fee has not been set.

I love to snuggle and give face kisses but please respect my space until we've established a relationship!  <p/><p/>I do like other dogs, but I'd like to get to know them first. I can be very afraid of them, so I would like to meet them and make sure we're a good match. I will likely get along with a calm dog who gives me lots of space. <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE.

It doesn't mean anything bad it just means when I was wee little one, I was not taught about how nice and awesome people can be to me. I'm very scared at first but once you take the time to show me I can trust you, I will melt in your arms. Although, I'm a fearful kitty, I actually really love to snuggle and purr! I would love to go to a home with one of my siblings or with a younger, confident kitty friend! <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.

My name is Frankie and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by a good samaritan on March 30th, 2019.<p/><p/>Notes from my foster home: <p/><p/>""Frankie is a beautiful, shy, tortoiseshell, young kitty - She my take a little bit to warm up to you but once she gets to know you, she loves being near you, getting pets from you and is a big-time purr machine! she likes to hold your hand right where she wants you to pet her. She came in with baby kittens and was a wonderful, nurturing mama to her babies and now deserves a nice, relaxing home to call her own. She is still young herself and likes to chase her feather toy and run after balls. She will make a great sofa companion and prefers to be next to you.""<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/><p/>",BLUEK19-117276,A585068,Regional Animal Services of King County,FOUND,https://petharbor.com/pet.asp?uaid=KING.A585068,"King County
